# Hii 👋

Thanks for stopping by! 
<br>

My name is Diana 👩🏻‍💻 and I am transitioning my career from Front End Web Developer to iOS Mobile Engineer. Here you will see a glimpse of my journey into the exciting world of iOS development (P.S. I love it here 😊). I am deeply committed to crafting and implementing digital solutions that address real-world challenges. My keen attention to detail, coupled with my ability to empathize with users, allows me to create user-centric designs and experiences.
