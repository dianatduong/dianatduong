**My name is Diana and I am an aspiring iOS Engineer** 👩🏻‍💻

#### A few things about me:
- 🕵🏻‍♀️ I am passionate about creating digital solutions that address real-world challenges
- 🧘🏻‍♀️ I possess a strong empathetic ability that enables me to deliver user experiences that are human-centered
- 🥰 In my free time, I find joy in traveling, playing pickleball, and dog-sitting for others through Rover 

#### iOS Apps I'm working on:  🚧
