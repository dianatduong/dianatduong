# Hii 👋

Thanks for stopping by! 
<br>

**My name is Diana and I am an aspiring iOS Engineer** 👩🏻‍💻
<br>🦎 In 2023, I made a bold career pivot from Web development to iOS! 
<br>Here you will see a glimpse into my exciting journey into the world of iOS development (P.S. I love it here 😊)

#### A few things about me:
- 🕵🏻‍♀️ I am passionate about creating digital solutions that address real-world challenges
- 🧘🏻‍♀️ I possess a strong empathetic ability that enables me to deliver user experiences that are human-centered
- 🥰 In my free time, I find joy in traveling, playing pickleball, and dog-sitting for others through Rover 

#### iOS Apps I'm working on:  🚧

- 🥾 **Hike Haven (UIKit)** - A hiking trail search app focused on providing essential information pre-adventure
- 🏠 **KodeHause (SwiftUI)**  - A project-sharing app for tech enthusiasts with a non-technical background
